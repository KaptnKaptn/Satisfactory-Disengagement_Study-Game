Thank you so much for buying my asset pack! It took quite some time for me to make it, but here we are :)

Backgrounds, Tiles and everything was made using the 240x160 resolution of the Game Boy Advanced. 
Why? You may ask.
Well, because that is the best resolution to work with pixel art, at least the style that i use. Sorry if you thought that this would feature high resolution and high pixel, refunds are acceptable.

Not every sprite is exactly 16x16, so if you see anything that is kinda weird, dm me on my personal Gmail: caio.cesar222@gmail.com

This pack contains a little bit of everything, but i decided to leave some things out of it because i thought that would be better if i make a vol. 2, with things that would enhance the pack as a whole.

Keep in mind that i will be fixing and adding some other things on this pack, so if you see anything wrong or have some idea that would be nice to add on this or the future pack, just comment on the pack page.

By helping each other we build a better community for us and future developers.

Thanks again!
